🌦️ Weather App
A simple yet evolving Weather Application built step-by-step to understand API integration, frontend design, and backend data management.

📌 Project Overview
This Weather App displays real-time weather data using a public weather API. The project progresses in three prototype stages:

🚀 Prototypes
✅ Prototype 1: Basic Weather App (Frontend + API)
Built with HTML and CSS.

Uses JavaScript to fetch live weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Displays weather info like temperature, humidity, and conditions in a simple UI.

✅ Prototype 2: Weather App with Database Integration
Backend added with Node.js/Python (update depending on what you used).

Weather data fetched from API is also saved into a database (e.g., MongoDB/MySQL).

Enhances functionality by storing historical data or offline fallback.

✅ Prototype 3: Smart Refresh with Caching
Every 10 seconds, new data is fetched from the API and stored in the database.

If the API fails or no data is returned, fallback to the last saved data from the database.

Ensures continuous display of data even during API outages.
